SpaTempHTP_Validation: Scripts and data to illustrate the functioning of the SpaTempHTP R package
====
  
  
## Overview
  
  The script folder contain a script that allow the user to perform analyses of time series data from high throughput phenotyping (HTP) platforms using the R package SpaTempHTP (https://github.com/ICRISAT-GEMS/SpaTemHTP). The data folder contain example dataset from four HTP experiments run on the LeasyScan platform. The experiments measured two traits (Leaf area 3D and plant height) from two association panels in different crop (CP: cheakpea and SG: sorghum). Each association panel was measured two times. It gives a total of eight datasets (2 crops x 2 experiments x 2 traits).
